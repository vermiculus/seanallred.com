# I have a topic suggestion

Great!, but *please* make sure your suggestions satisfy the following:

- Make sure your idea is about TeX.  I have thoughts on a lot of other
  different things, but I've decided to keep this blog focused on this
  (very broad) topic.  Within this domain, anything is fair game.
- If you have resources or a minimal example for your suggestion,
  please include them in the submission.

# I have a suggestion on your site design

Oh, goodness yes.  Frankly, I have no business being on the internet
-- I have *no* idea what I'm doing here.  Suggestions for how to make
the site better are more than welcome, but please remember that this
is primarily a blog: content comes first.

Thanks for your help!
