# I have a topic suggestion.

Great!  I relish the chance to learn new things.  Please make sure
your suggestions satisfy the following conditions.

- Make sure your idea is about TeX or Emacs.  I have thoughts on a lot
  of other different things, but I've decided to keep this blog
  focused on these two topics.  Within these domains, anything is fair
  game.
- If you have resources concerning a suggestion, please include them
  in the issue.
- Please don't feel bad if I don't write about your suggestion.  I'm
  only one guy with a full-time job and an intense hobby -- I've only
  got so much time...

# I have a suggestion on your site design.

Oh, goodness yes.  Frankly, I have no business being on the internet
-- I have *no* idea what I'm doing here.  Suggestions for how to make
the site better are more than welcome, but please remember that this
is primarily a blog: content comes first.

Thanks for your help!
