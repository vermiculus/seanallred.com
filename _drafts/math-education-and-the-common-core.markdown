There is good pedagogical reasoning that goes on behind this, and this
post (that's been going around for some time now) is intentionally
inflammatory.  I'm not on a good connection right now and can't really
dive in, but I'll write up a blog post about it on
vermiculus.github.io sometime today.

TL;DR: Math education is *hard* and there are no simple answers.  This
is the most intuitive explanation of subtraction there is, and it will
work for more complicated cases (e.g. 34-55, 2.4-0.8, etc.) where the
"old fashioned way" (which will *still* be taught!) simply says
'memorize'.
