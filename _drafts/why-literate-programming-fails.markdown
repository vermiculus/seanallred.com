title: Why Literate Programming Fails

I am a huge fan of literate programming -- the practice of writing
software for people rather than for computers.  Literate programming
provides code that is meant to be read as much as run.  The paradigm
is a fantastic tool to assure yourself that the solution is correct
and robust.  It requires that you understand the problem and its
solution perfectly.  Unfortunately, it requires that you understand
the problem and its solution perfectly.

I attempted to write an ongoing project of mine, `sx.el`, using
literate programming.  For some time it worked well, but I quickly
came to the realization that I had no idea what I was talking about.
It was and is a constant learning experience.  It requires you to know
how the system is organized before you organize it -- a noble
aspiration, but an unrealistic one.  While I still intend to release
it as a literate program some day, the paradigm is not fit for
experimental development of large software projects within the scope
of the implementation I am using.
