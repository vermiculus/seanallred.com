I've seen a few people here and there refer to LaTeX3 and `expl3`
interchangeably.  While they're very related, they are distinct from
each other.

`expl3`
: The format-independent programming layer powering LaTeX3.  Provides
tools to make programming in a TeX environment saner.  Under
development, maintained, and stable.

LaTeX3
: The new format of LaTeX, successor to LaTeX2e.  Under development
and not yet released.

`expl3` is ready for primetime, but LaTeX3 is not.  That said, many
*ideas* from LaTeX3 are available for use in a *status quo* referred
to as 'LaTeX3 in 2e'.  Packages like `xparse`, `l3keys2e`, and
`xtemplate` provide an idea of what working in LaTeX3 is going to feel
like.

It's important to note that the general format of

{% highlight latex %}
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
hello, world
\end{document}
{% endhighlight %}

will not be changing (lest the project fail to be adopted).  Most of
the changes will occur on the programming and document-design level.
