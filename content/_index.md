Hello, weary traveller!

My name is Sean Allred and I am a software developer and enthusiast
currently enjoying Madison, Wisconsin.  I spend most of my time
working at [Epic][epic.com] making healthcare safer, but I also
develop in my free time using a variety of technologies just for
funsies.  When I'm not at a computer, I enjoy looking outside waiting
for winter to end.

[I have no particular affinity towards ducks.][ducks]

I've recently migrated this site from Jekyll to Hugo with which I'm
personally having much greater success.  During this process, some
links may have broken (even though I've taken some care to avoid
this)Â -- if you come across any broken links, please report them by
[opening a GitHub issue][github].  This migration happened a bit more
suddenly than I had planned, so bear with me through any issues :-)

Previously, this content tried to be TeX-focused.  I've come to
realize that kind of focus is a silly idea for me.  I do what I want.
