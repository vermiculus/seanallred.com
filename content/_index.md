Hello, weary traveler!

My name is Sean Allred and I am a software developer and enthusiast
currently enjoying Madison, Wisconsin. I spend most of my time working
at [Epic][epic.com] making healthcare safer, but I also [develop in my
free time][github.com] using a variety of technologies just for
funsies. When I'm not at a computer, I enjoy looking outside waiting
for winter to end.

I'm in the process of refreshing this site to use MkDocs, a platform
I've recently become much more familiar with. During this process,
some links may be broken.

Previously, this content tried to be TeX-focused. I've come to realize
that kind of laser focus here is a silly idea for me.

I do what I want.
