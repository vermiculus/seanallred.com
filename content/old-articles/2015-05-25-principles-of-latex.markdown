On Reddit, [it was asked][r-principles] (spelling revised):

<!--more-->

> What are the principles of LaTeX?
>
> I've just started learning LaTeX and would like to truly master it
> and in a reasonable amount of time.
>
> I'd like to learn it [Elon Musk-style][r-p-em], though, relating

I was then on-the-go and didn't have the resources to provide a full
answer, so I provided a [pithy comment][r-p-comment]:

> For TeX, learn about typesetting (and then use `expl3`).
>
> For LaTeX, learn about writing.

It was met with no response, so I acknowledged it as insufficient per
lack of explanation.  You wanted an way to learn LaTeX from the ground
up so, without further ado, an explanation:

# Why was TeX was created?

In the 1970s, Donald Knuth was writing what was to become his master
work: [*The Art of Computer Programming*][taocp].

# Why was LaTeX was created?
# What drives LaTeX development?
