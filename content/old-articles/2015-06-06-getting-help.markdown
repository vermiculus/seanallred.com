There are three ways people come by TeX:

<!--more-->

mentorship

: Someone like myself [bothers you about it][bother] until you give it
  a try.  Having a mentor is probably the best way to learn (assuming
  your mentor actually knows the material).  It's nice to have someone
  there who will take the time to walk you through it in person.  All
  *you* have to do is have a genuine desire to learn.

curiosity

: You find it in the course of research when faced with some
  writing/typesetting problem.  This can also be very good: when you
  take the primary, active role in learning (which you should be doing
  with *mentorship*, too), you'll want to learn the *best* way to do
  things today.  You may not always find good information, but you'll
  figure that out eventually.

coercion

: You are forced to use it by some higher power (institution, journal,
  etc.).  This is without a doubt the *worst* way to start using TeX
  for what I hope is an obvious reason: nobody likes being forced to
  do something.  If you just 'want something done', you don't
  particularly care how you do it or if it's the 'right' way to do it.

Since a random guy on the internet can't compete with someone who's
right there (a mentor), I won't speak much on that.  Just know that
your mentor isn't perfect either -- we are all still learning the
ropes in some fashion -- so don't be afraid to challenge ideas about
what's best.

As for coercion and curiosity, these are where you must learn TeX on
your own.  Since most people who learn in this manner end up learning
LaTeX, I'll use that as my example throughout this article.

Every new thing you learn comes with what seems to be an endless
fountain of questions.
