I recently switched from DreamHost to registration with
[Google Domains][google-dns].  It was an *absolutely lovely*
experience.

Since I'm powering this site with Jekyll now (and continuing to learn
more about it as I go), I can host with GitHub Pages.  That means I
only need to register the domain name, which is considerably cheaper
than hosting.

[Configuring DreamHost to do this was a nightmare.][dh-dns]

[google-dns]: //domains.google.com
