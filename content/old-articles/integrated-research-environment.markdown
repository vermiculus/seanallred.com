Programmers have long had integrated *development* environments --
with all manners of tools in the same programÂ -- but not many other
diverse efforts are so blessed.  Research in particular often boasts
hundreds of different resources, not to mention several different
tools for statistics/illustrations, complete with deadlines for
abstracts and various drafts.

I don't think any serious conversation about a TeX-based workflow is
complete without some mention of that venerable
editor-turned-operating-system, Emacs.  With its long history of
development and growing user base, Emacs (and a few packages that I'll
discuss) provide a first-class home base for your research, whether
that research is academic or professional.

So what goes into research?

- sources
- notes
- tasks
- deadlines
- writing

And of course, all of this must be well-organized.

There are many applications that try to solve this problem.  One that
I've recently been referred to is called graphical application called
*Scrivener*, a fifty-dollar investment.
