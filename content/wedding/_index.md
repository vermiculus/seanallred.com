# RSVP
If you haven't already, please [fill out the RSVP](/wedding/rsvp).

# Hotel Reservations
Please feel free to make a reservation in the Frederick, MD area.
Downtown is about [15--20 minutes away from the venue][dir], so there
are lots of options!

# For our Midwest folks...
If you're flying, BWI is the easiest airport to get in/out of and it's
no farther than the other options in the area (IAD/Dulles,
DCA/Reagan).  Traffic on the Capital Beltway is dependably bad --
think Chicago during rush hour -- so it's best to avoid it if
possible.
