I have recently fielded concerns about using the
[LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL)][lppl] ([unofficial tl;dr][tldr])
for open source work as opposed to more popular licenses like the GPL
or Creative Commons series of licenses.  In this article, I wish to
describe (as best I know) the intent of the LPPL and its importance in
the TeX community.

First, I'd like to direct you to Frank Mittelbach's article on
[reflections on the history of the LPPL][lppl-hist].  It describes the
license's evolution from TeX's own peculiar license
[provided by Knuth][tex]:

> If this program is changed, the resulting system should not be
> called 'TeX'.

In addition, Knuth placed TeX and its sources into the public domain.
It was and is free to all to use for whatever purpose they saw fit.

Skipping some truly fascinating history, the LaTeX Project was borne
of this fertile incubator of good-willed generosity.
